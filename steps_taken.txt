Steps Taken
1. Install git on built-in node and buildserver 1 & 2
2. Install python on built-in node
3. Tested unstable in main stages with bat "exit /b 3"

Assumptions
1. No additional plug-ins can be installed. Pipeline should use already installed plug-ins only.
  https://plugins.jenkins.io/badge/ - Provides a simpler, cleaner mechanism for badging/tagging Jenkins builds.
2. GoG and Steam versions will always be in the provided format.
3. GoG and Steam versions will always be the same version.
4. Even if version is older than previous build, patch creation should be executed.
5. Assignment is to check version in previousBuild to see if currentBuild is a new version,
  but it probably makes more sense to check all previously successful builds to see
  if this version was built already before creating the badge.
